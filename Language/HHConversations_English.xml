    <Conversation line="The rotting corpse in that old diver's suit?" speaker="1">
      <Conversation line="Yeah, that one. It came in through the airlock last shift. Hasn't moved much since." speaker="0">
        <Conversation line="What in the world does it want?" speaker="1">
          <Conversation line="If it wants anything at all. It's just standing there, sort of swaying, drooling black sludge." speaker="0">
            <Conversation line="Smells like the sea, but old and foul." speaker="2" allowedjobs="medicaldoctor">
              <Conversation line="I heard clicking from it last night. Like teeth rattling or a hollow knock against its helmet." speaker="0">

                  <Conversation line="Hell no. It's basically glued to that suit, like a shell." speaker="0">

        <Conversation line="You mean like a parasite or fungus controlling it?" speaker="0">
          <Conversation line="Could be. We know there are spores down here that cling to old suits." speaker="2">
